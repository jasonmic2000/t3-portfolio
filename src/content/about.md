# About Me

#### Hello there!

My name is Jason Michael.<br>

I'm a Computer Science graduate specializing
in Web Development. I am currently working as a Software Engineer (React) with the
Web Manager team at  
<a href="https://www.maxxton.com/" target="blank">Maxxton Technologies</a>.<br>

My first exposure to programming was in the 7th grade when our curriculum taught
us BASIC and Logo (the app with the triangle called the "Turtle").  
In later years,I had opportunities to learn HTML, Java, and Database Management
with SQL. I also learned a lot during my Bachelor's degree (C++, more SQL, Php)
and came back around to Web Development. This time I decided to stick with it.<br>

The languages and frameworks I currently know and work with are -
TypeScript, React, and NextJS (recently been learning the T3 stack).<br>

What do I do outside programming work? I've been a gamer most of my life,
with a lot of interest in and curiosity about the industry.<br>
I've spent my free time learning about Design, Game Dev, Voice Acting,
and a slew of other things. In whatever time's left, you'd likely find me
on Discord with friends, playing Overwatch or some other game we picked up that week.<br>

If you'd like to reach out to me, hire me, or wish to collaborate on any project,
do find me at any of my social links [here](https://dev.jasonjmichael.com/links)
(or <a href="mailto:jasonmic2000@gmail.com">email</a>,
if you prefer).<br><br>

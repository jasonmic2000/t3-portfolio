# About Me

Hello there!
My name is Jason Michael. I'm a Computer Science graduate with a particular interest in Web Development. I currently work as a React developer with the Web Manager team at Maxxton Technologies.
My first exposure to programming was in the 7th grade when our curriculum taught us BASIC and Logo (the app with the triangle called the "Turtle"). In later years, I had opportunities to learn HTML, Java, and Database Management with SQL. I also learned a lot during my Bachelor's degree (C++, more SQL, Php) and came back around to Web Development. This time I decided to stick with it.
The languages and frameworks I currently know and work with are - TypeScript, React, and NextJS (recently been learning the T3 stack).
What do I do outside programming work? I've been a gamer almost all my life, with a lot of interest in and curiosity about the industry. I've spent my free time learning about design, game dev, Voice Acting, and a slew of other things. In whatever time's left, you'd likely find me online on Discord with friends, playing Overwatch or some other game we picked up that week.
If you'd like to reach out to me, hire me, or wish to collaborate on anything, do find me at any of my social links here (or email, if you prefer).

Oh, and also, here's my resume/CV.
